## Open in Project IDX 

## How to use the template

This template allows opening Android tutorials in IDX IDE. To open a code sample in IDX, go to `https://idx.google.com/new?template=https://github.com/googlemaps-samples/android-samples/idx/open-in-idx-template` and provide the gitUrl, subdir and the name of the activity to launch as query params. Please review the template parameters in idx-template.json file. If a parameter is not provided, the default value will be used. 

You would also need to provide an API Key as a query parameter. Alternatively you could provide one in the IDX workspace creation dialog.

The example below demonstates how you could open a code sample in IDX. The link in the example will open the code sample specified by the default values in idx-template.json and you'd be asked to provide an API Key on IDX workspace creation dialog.
