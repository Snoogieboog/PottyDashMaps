(RESPA) Real estate settlement procedures act looks out for the interest of residential homeowners not business owners due to the fact that they have teams of people dedicated to getting shit right. The government think their smarter than RESPA so therefor they are exempt from RESPA.

The Good Faith Estimate (GFE) is the required disclosure of the known or anticipated fees, charges or settlement costs that the mortgage applicant is likely to incur at the settlement (closing) of the loan. Each such estimate must be made in good faith and bear a reasonable relationship to the charge a borrower is likely to pay at closing. It must be delivered within three business days of receiving or preparing an application.

If it helps, you may want to remember these items with the acronym ANVILS (Address, Name, Value, Income, Loan Amount, SSN) After you have that information the disclosure clock starts ticking.
